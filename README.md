Assignment 1

Question:
Implement a search engine by choosing a relevant corpus. 
The search engine should include implementation of inverted index. 
The implementation should include i)Boolean Model ii) retrieval based on similarity 
The text content should be pre-processed before the creation of inverted index. 
Implementation should support phrase queries (combination of Bi-word index and positional indexing).
The retrieved documents should appear in a ranked manner.
Precision and Recall should be computed.
Analysis Report:
In addition to implementation, each group should submit a detailed Analysis report that should include 
i) Justification of pre-processing techniques used
ii)  justification for choosing an appropriate data structure
iii) justification for choosing a typical similarity scoring scheme
